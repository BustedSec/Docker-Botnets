Dear MoneroOcean,

hello...there is currently a botnet that is utilizing your service.

The account username and password in question can be found within wtf.json

The credentials are as follows

* User: 4Aotje6mGNPRcDQeqS7iUwRLGJhLLgJvfbS6Dju5peSACbVXTFhnds53xuoqif3JEcfbdjiW27xuAJiiKeiCGbuoACrutNE
* Password: woohoo

at the top of every file you can see that there is a pastebin link to where you can find the source.

Files of interest for your company:

* d1_paste.txt
* wtf.json (naming convention is crass as I found the passwords to another botnet last week)

Thank you for your service and I am contactable at any time at my twitter handle @suprn8



regards,

Caprico
